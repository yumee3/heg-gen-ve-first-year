# Exercise – Garage Door Opening System (Packet Tracer)

## Objective
Simulate an automatic garage door opening system using Packet Tracer with IoT sensors and actuators.

## Description
- Simulation of an automatic open/close mechanism.
- Use of proximity sensors and actuators.
- Simple programming through conditional logic (block-based or script).
- Display of door status (open / closed).

## Skills Covered
- Conditional logic (if/else)
- Introduction to IoT devices in Packet Tracer
- Synchronization between sensors and actuators

## Tests to Perform
- Manual triggering simulation
- Automatic triggering simulation
